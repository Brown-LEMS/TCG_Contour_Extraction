Need to mention that this package is still under development, so that the evaluation results might not be as exact as reported in the published papers. 

Setup: 
	This package is tested on Ubuntu system and Matlab after 2012. In some case you need to link your system cxx lib to matlab installed cxx lib
	The built excutable 'util/dborl_compute_curve_frags' only works on Ubuntu 12.04 or later version relying on corresponding c and c++ libs. If you need to compile it from you system, you need to install vxl and lemsvxl libaray first. Please contact the author for details.
	
Prepare edge maps:

	Follow the directory structure in 'Data/TO_SEL_CFGD/'. Construct your own test folder 'Data/****/', prepare your edgemap in the format as our '.edg' file and put them in 'Data/****/edges/'. 
	
	We provide a few third-party edge detectors, but with more accurate orientation modification (third-order orientation correction), check:
	util/gPb_detector/Main_CFGD_gPb_TO.m     "Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation, Arbelaez etal, PAMI 2011"
	util/SE_Dollar_detector/edgesDemo_TO.m    "Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection, Dollar and Zitnick, ICCV 2013"
        util/multispectral_TO/main_multispectual_TO_VOC2007.m    "No grouping left behind: From edges to curve fragments, Tamrakar and Kimia, ICCV 2007"
	
Compute Final Curves:
	Change the paths in 'demo_compute_SEL'.
	Change the 'Prefix' to 'TO_SEL' or 'gPb_SEL' or 'SE_SEL'depending on your edgemap. Prefix is to load in the trained classifier weights for the corresponding edgemap input.
	

Evaluation:
	check 'Eval/main_eval_CFGD_varying_num' with your paths (****), and your prefix name (####)

	
Evaluation contour maps directly:
	Need to prepare the contour maps in the format of '.cem' in 'Data/****/final_curves/'.
	look at 'util/io/write_cem.m' to understand the format of '.cem' file.
	Follow the Training steps 4,5, and run Evaluation.
